# Honey Badger
A programming language developed by me and implemented in OCaml.

Honey Badger is intended to be a dynamically-scope, dynamically-typed
language, with dictionaries and arrays as language builtins.

# Requirements
Honey Badger currently depends on ocaml, ocamldoc, opam,
JaneStreet's core library, and menhir. The commands listed under
install in the .travis.yml file can tell you what to do to get them
on Ubuntu.
